				The challenge for educators is to move beyond thinking of IT as a tool, or “IT-enabled education platforms”. Instead, they need to think about how to nurture students’ ability and confidence to excel both online and offline in a world where digital media is ubiquitous. An individual’s facility and command of digital media is a competence that can be measured- according to World Economic Forum, it's called DQ: digital intelligence. DQ is an intelligence that is highly adaptive.
			</div>

			<br />

			DQ can broadly be broken down into three levels:

			<h1>Level 1: Digital citizenship</h1>

			The ability to use digital technology and media in safe, responsible and effective ways

			<h1>Level 2: Digital creativity</h1>

			The ability to become a part of the digital ecosystem by co-creating new content and turning ideas into reality by using digital tools

			<h1>Level 3: Digital entrepreneurship</h1>

			The ability to use digital media and technologies to solve global challenges or to create new opportunities

			Of the three, digital creativity is the least neglected, as more and more schools attempt to provide children with some exposure to media literacy, coding and even robotics, all of which are seen as directly related to future employability and job creation. Likewise, there are major education initiatives – from America’s code.org to Africa’s IamTheCode.org – that promote access to coding education.

			<br />
			<br />

			<div class="col-md-offset-3">
				Digital entrepreneurship has also been actively encouraged, particularly in tertiary education. Many top universities have adopted and developed new courses or initiatives such as technopreneurship and entrepreneurship hackathons to encourage a culture of innovation. We’re even starting to see global movements that nurture social entrepreneurship among children through mentoring programmes – such as the Mara Foundation – and school programmes, like with the Ashoka Changemaker School.
			</div>

			<br />

			But digital citizenship has often been overlooked by educators and leaders. This is in spite of the fact it is fundamental to a person’s ability to use technology and live in the digital world, a need which arises from a very young age. A child should start learning digital citizenship as early as possible, ideally when one starts actively using games, social media or any digital device. 

			<br />

			<div class="col-md-offset-3">
				<h5>Teachers normally think that children will pick these skills up on their own, or that they should be nurtured at home.</h5> However, with only more recent generations being the ones to truly live in the era of smartphones and social media, parents and teachers are normally found at a loss when faced with these issues. This leads to too many opportunities for children to be exposed to threats ranging from cyberbullying to more serious ones such as grooming and technology addiction with little to no knowledge on how to deal with these problems. They can also absorb toxic behavioural norms that affect their ability to interact with others. And even most children already encounter such challenges, the problems are amplified for vulnerable children. Minorities, children with special needs, and the economically disadvantaged tend to be both more frequently exposed to risk and more likely to face severe outcomes.

			Of course, these facts are concerning, and depending on who you are, you may be aching to know how to help, or you may be surprised by the amount of risk, or you may be in that same position right now. No matter who you are, DIGITALLY is crafted to help you understand the do's and dont's of digital citizenship, whether it be for you, a family member, or a class. Now, according to World Economic Forum, the following are the elements that create digital citizenship and should be taught well:

			Digital citizen identity: the ability to build and manage a healthy identity online and offline with integrity

			Screen time management: the ability to manage one’s screen time, multitasking, and one’s engagement in online games and social media with self-control

			Cyberbullying management: the ability to detect situations of cyberbullying and handle them wisely

			Cybersecurity management: the ability to protect one’s data by creating strong passwords and to manage various cyberattacks

			Privacy management: the ability to handle with discretion all personal information shared online to protect one’s and others’ privacy

			Critical thinking: the ability to distinguish between true and false information, good and harmful content, and trustworthy and questionable contacts online

			Digital footprints: The ability to understand the nature of digital footprints and their real-life consequences and to manage them responsibly

			Digital empathy: the ability to show empathy towards one’s own and others’ needs and feelings online		
			<br />
			<br />
			<h1>What a quality digital education looks like</h1>

				There must be opportunities for assessment and feedback, and assessment tools should be comprehensive and adaptive to evaluate both hard and soft DQ skills (???). These will give children a better understanding of their weaknesses and strengths so that they can find their own paths to success.
