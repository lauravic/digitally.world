			As time passes, more people are exposed to the wonders of the internet at progressively younger ages. This is rational, considering society's quick transition to the digital world, but is not addressed enough. The majority of children with access to the internet do not know how to handle the risks and responsibilities that go hand in hand with it. Without this knowledge surges the risk of cyberbullying, sexual harassment, stolen identities, addiction the the internet, and insomnia, which in turn could cause anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and attention problems. Just like innovation and creative individuals, problems and problematic people are a normal part of the internet, but how one decides to deal with them is what matters.
			<br />
			<br />
			Doubtless, technology advances at a mind-boggling speed and holds many benefits. But we as consumers do have to learn as we progress and advance of the pros and the cons of all that occurs so that true progress can bloom from here.

			<br />-->

			<!--We're at a point in life where the generational gap causes uncertainty and fear in what younger children could be seeing. Our parents never lived fully immersed in a technological world like we do, so they tend to not know how to help when cyber-issues pop up. From this stem many problems people could face from a young age simply because they don't have the experience to handle them well and no knowledgable person to turn to. They won't have any guidelines on how to manage having digital citizenship. This is a website designed to answer questions on thriving on the internet as simply as possible, hoping to entertain children along the way.-->
